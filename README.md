- **Regular clone, no submodules**
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/byte-ranger-software/indy-foy.git
  ```

- **Developers who need access to archived resources in `originals/`**
  
  ```bash
  # Requires read access to the private submodule
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/byte-ranger-software/indy-foy.git
  # or, if already cloned
  git submodule update --init originals
  ```
